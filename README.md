## Status

    Project is in progress (February 2022 - Present)

## Why

        After completing a Udemy course on HTML and CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann,
    I wanted to test out my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

    I decided to develop a website for a fictitious business.
    The fictitious business is called Primtetime Automotive Detailing LLC.

    I came up with the idea, because I thought that a car detailing business would need various features
    such as a Gallery, Pricing plans, FAQs, a Contact form, and more.

    	2 years later, after gaining more experience with JavaScript through online resources such as Frontend Masters
        and Youtube,
    I decided to implement more features on this project.

    I revamped the form section and improved the sticky navigation bar.

    The form is multi step and has a progress bar on top.

    I also added validations for the appointment date with the earliest date being the current date and the latest being 2 months in advance.

## Approach

    I created the page from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    I came up with the design and theme of the site and designed the logo on Canva and used various sources for the pictures.

    CSS - The theme of the website is Simple/Minimalist and Startup/Upbeat. Desktop first approach.

    JS - Used MDN documentation and followed various youtube tutorials.
