# Automotive Detailing - HTML CSS Project 


## Link to Website
https://primetimeautodetail.netlify.app

## Why 
    After completing a Udemy course on HTML and CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann, I wanted to test out my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. 
    I decided to develop a website for a fictitious business. The fictitious business is called Primtetime Automotive Detailing LLC. 
    I came up with the idea, because I thought that a car detailing business would need various features such as a Gallery, Pricing plans, FAQs, a Contact form, and more. 

## Approach

    I created the page from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I came up with the design and theme of the site. 
    I used other webpages and designs for inspiration. I designed the logo on Canva and used various sources for the pictures. 

    The theme of the website is Simple/Minimalist and Startup/Upbeat.
